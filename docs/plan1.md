# plan1.md — Responsive layout & About section structure

## Task / Feature

Refining the responsive behaviour of the layout and improving
the structure and composition of the About section.

## Phase 1 — Prompt to AI

"I already have a one-page portfolio website.
I need help reviewing and planning responsive behaviour
for different breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop),
and improving the layout of the About section
(image + text composition), without generating final code."

## Phase 1 — AI Response (Plan)

The AI suggested:

- A mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Adjusting layout at specific breakpoints instead of adding new pages
- Using Flexbox/Grid to stack content on small screens
  and align image/text side by side on larger screens
- Keeping typography and spacing consistent with the existing design

## Phase 2 — Implementation Notes

I applied the responsive ideas selectively:

- Adjusted breakpoints to fit my existing design
- Refined the About section layout using my own HTML and CSS
- Manually styled spacing, alignment and proportions
- No code was copied directly; the AI was used only for planning
